# Althea's Chores - Part 1 of The Witch's Apprentice questline
#
# Before Althea will reveal the witch's location, the player must:
# 1. Brew her a nice, hot cup of tea
# 2. Make her some cookies (shop-bought won't do)
# 3. Clean her house by removing all 5 spider webs
#
# Complex logic (cobweb mini-game, item delivery, feather duster)
# is handled by the TypeScript handler in data/questHandlers/altheaChoresHandler.ts
