# Gardening Quest - Help Elias tend the communal garden
#
# The village elder asks the player to help with seasonal gardening tasks:
# - Spring: Plant spring seeds (tomato, pea, sunflower), bring back a crop
# - Summer: Plant summer seeds (carrot, corn, chili), bring back a crop
# - Autumn: Plant onion sets, bring back honey from the bear
# - Winter: Wait for spring
#
# Seasonal logic, seed distribution, and crop delivery are handled by
# the TypeScript handler in data/questHandlers/gardeningQuestHandler.ts
