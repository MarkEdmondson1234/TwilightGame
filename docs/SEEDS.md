# Seeds Guide

Seeds are the foundation of farming. This guide explains how to obtain different types of seeds in the game.

## Where to Find Seeds

### 1. Seed Shed (Free Seeds)

The quickest way to get started is the **Seed Shed** in the farm area:

1. From the **Village**, head to the bottom-right corner (around 28, 28)
2. Enter the **Farm Area** through the transition
3. Find the **Seed Shed** building and enter through the door
4. Talk to the seed bag NPCs along the tables to collect free seeds

**Available at the Seed Shed:**
- Radish Seeds (10) - fast growing, great for beginners
- Tomato Seeds (10) - medium growth time
- Salad Seeds (5) - longer growth, good yields
- Corn Seeds (3) - slow but profitable

> Note: The Seed Shed provides unlimited free seeds during testing. In the future, this will be replaced with a proper shop system.

### 2. Shop Seeds

Some seeds can be purchased from shops using gold:

| Seed | Cost | Growth | Best For |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| Radish | 5g | Fast (2 min) | Beginners |
| Spinach | 8g | Fast (4 min) | Quick harvests |
| Salad | 10g | Medium (10 min) | Fresh greens |
| Chili | 15g | Medium (10 min) | Spicy dishes |
| Broccoli | 20g | Medium (10 min) | Healthy crops |
| Cauliflower | 25g | Medium (12 min) | Cooking |
| Corn | 25g | Slow (15 min) | High profit |
| Melon | 30g | Medium (12 min) | Summer refreshment |
| Pumpkin | 50g | Slow (20 min) | Highest profit |

### 3. Friendship Seeds

Befriending villagers unlocks special seed rewards! The **Old Man (Jebediah)** in the village is particularly fond of sharing his gardening knowledge.

**How to increase friendship:**
- Talk to NPCs daily (+1 friendship level)
- Give them gifts
- Complete quests for them

**Seeds from the Old Man** (when reaching "Acquaintance" status):
- Sunflower Seeds (3) - bright and cheerful
- Pea Seeds (3) - sweet and fast-growing
- Lettuce Seeds (3) - perfect for salads

**Other Friendship Seeds** (unlocked through befriending villagers):
- Tomato Seeds - a classic garden favourite
- Carrot Seeds - crunchy and nutritious
- Cucumber Seeds - cool and refreshing
- Onion Seeds - plant in autumn only!

### 4. Foraging Seeds

Explore the **Forest** to discover wild seeds! Press **F** whilst standing on grass, ferns, or mushrooms to forage.

**How to Forage:**
1. Travel to the forest (from village, head north-east)
2. Stand on grass, ferns, or mushroom tiles
3. Press **F** to search for seeds (or tap the 🌿 button on touch devices)
4. You have a 50% chance of finding something each time

**Forage Seeds:**
- Strawberry Seeds (Rare) - sweet wild strawberries
- Plus any common seeds based on rarity

Foraging uses a rarity system:
- 40% chance: Common seeds
- 30% chance: Uncommon seeds
- 20% chance: Rare seeds
- 10% chance: Very rare seeds

Keep searching - persistence pays off!

### 5. Harvest Drops

When you harvest fully-grown crops, there's a chance to receive seeds back:
- Each crop drops between 1-3 seeds on harvest
- Some crops (like Sunflowers and Chilis) drop more seeds than others
- This makes farming self-sustaining over time

## Seed Categories Summary

| Source | Seeds Available | How to Unlock |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Seed Shed | Radish, Tomato, Salad, Corn | Visit the farm area |
| Shops | Most common seeds | Buy with gold |
| Friendship | Sunflower, Pea, Lettuce, Tomato, Carrot, Cucumber, Onion | Befriend villagers |

## Tips for New Farmers

1. **Start with Radishes** - They grow quickly (2 minutes) and are forgiving for beginners
2. **Talk to the Old Man daily** - He'll reward your friendship with seeds
3. **Save some seeds** - Don't plant everything; keep reserves for replanting
4. **Check the season** - Some crops only grow in specific seasons (Onions need Autumn!)
5. **Water regularly** - Watered crops grow faster and won't wilt

## Seasonal Planting

Not all seeds can be planted year-round:

| Season | Available Crops |
|--------|----------------|
| Spring | Most crops (Radish, Tomato, Salad, Corn, etc.) |
| Summer | Radish, Spinach, Lettuce, Chili, Salad, Corn, Carrot |
| Autumn | Onion (only season for this crop!) |
| Winter | Nothing can be planted |

Plan your farming calendar wisely!
