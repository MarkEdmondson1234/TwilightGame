## Understanding the HUD

The HUD (heads-up display) in the top-left shows:
- **Current Tool** - What you have equipped (Hand, Hoe, Seeds, Watering Can)
- **Selected Seed** - Which crop you'll plant (when Seeds tool is active)
- **Seed Count** - How many seeds you have in inventory
- **Gold** - Your current money
- **Time** - Current in-game time, day, season, and year

## Talking to NPCs

When you're near an NPC (non-player character), you'll see a blue prompt: **[E] Talk to [Name]**

Press **E** to start a conversation. Some NPCs will:
- Give you items (like seeds)
- Share stories and lore
- Provide quests (coming soon!)

Press **E** or **ESC** to close dialogue and continue playing.

## Map Navigation

Look for glowing transition indicators when you're near exits:
- **Yellow border** - Transition nearby
- **Green border + pulsing** - Ready to use (press E)
- Label shows where the transition leads

Press **E** when the indicator is green to travel to a new area.

## Farming Tips

### Water Management
- Plants need water every few minutes (varies by crop)
- Unwatered plants will **wilt** (turn yellow)
- Wilted plants will **die** if not watered in time
- Dead plants must be cleared with Hand tool (returns plot to fallow)

### Crop Strategy
- **Radishes** - Fast and easy, great for beginners
- **Tomatoes** - Better profit, needs more attention
- **Wheat** - Hardy crop, good bulk harvest
- **Corn** - Premium crop, requires patience
- **Pumpkins** - Specialty crop, huge profit but takes longest

### Maximizing Profit
1. Water regularly to speed up growth
2. Plant multiple plots at once
3. Stagger planting times for continuous harvests
4. Higher-tier crops give more gold per harvest

## Troubleshooting

### Can't plant seeds?
- Make sure soil is **tilled** (not fallow)
- Check you have seeds in inventory
- Verify Seeds tool is equipped (press 3)
- Select a seed type (press 5-9)

### Tile not updating?
- Tiles update immediately after actions
- If stuck, try moving one tile to refresh

### Lost or stuck?
- Press **R** to teleport to spawn point
- Use map transitions to navigate between areas

- Different map areas with unique themes
