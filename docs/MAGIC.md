# Magic & Potions

## Overview

Magic in the game comes primarily from potions brewed at cauldrons. Potions can change the weather, affect time, help your farm, and even change your size!

## Brewing Potions

To brew potions:
1. Find a cauldron (in the witch's cottage or certain locations)
2. Click on the cauldron or press **E** when standing next to it
3. Select a recipe from your Magic Book
4. Add the required ingredients
5. Brew and collect your potion!

Potions are stored in your inventory and can be used anytime by clicking on them.

## Size-Changing Potions

Two special potions let you change your size - inspired by a certain famous tea party!

### Drink Me (Shrink)

The "Drink Me" potion makes you **one size smaller**. Use it multiple times to become truly tiny!

### Eat Me (Grow)

The "Eat Me" potion makes you **one size larger**. Stack the effect to become a giant!

### Size Tiers

There are 7 size tiers you can be:

| Tier | Name | Scale | Description |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| -3 | Tiny | 0.25x | Mouse-sized! Can fit through tiny holes |
| -2 | Very Small | 0.5x | Half your normal size |
| -1 | Small | 0.7x | Slightly smaller than normal |
| 0 | Normal | 1.0x | Your default size |
| +1 | Large | 1.4x | Noticeably bigger |
| +2 | Very Large | 2.0x | Twice your normal size |
| +3 | Giant | 3.0x | Tower over everything! |

### How the Potions Work Together

The two potions are **opposites**:
- **Drink Me** moves you DOWN one tier (shrinks you)
- **Eat Me** moves you UP one tier (grows you)

This means if you're a Giant (+3) and want to return to Normal (0), you need to drink **three** "Drink Me" potions!

**Example:**
1. Start at Normal (0)
2. Drink "Eat Me" → Large (+1)
3. Drink "Eat Me" → Very Large (+2)
4. Drink "Drink Me" → Large (+1)
5. Drink "Drink Me" → Normal (0)

### Size-Restricted Areas

**Important:** Most doorways have size limits!

- **Standard doors** allow up to **Large** size to pass through
- If you grow to **Very Large** or **Giant**, you won't fit through regular doors!
- You'll need to drink "Drink Me" potions to shrink back down before you can enter buildings

Some special passages have different restrictions:
- **Tiny passages** (like mouse holes) require you to be Very Small or Tiny
- **Giant doors** may require you to be Large or bigger to push open

When you approach a size-restricted passage:
- If you're the **wrong size**, the door appears greyed out
- A message tells you what size you need to be
- Use the appropriate potion to change your size and try again!

**Tip:** Always keep some "Drink Me" potions handy if you like growing big - you'll need them to get back indoors!

- **Weather for farming**: Use Raincaller to water all your crops at once, saving time and watering can trips
