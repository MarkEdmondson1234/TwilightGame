# Decorations & Crafting

## Overview

The decoration system lets you personalise your home with handmade crafts. Paint your own artwork on the easel, arrange foraged flowers in vases, or pot your favourite crops. Every decoration is crafted from materials you gather yourself.

## Getting Started

To begin crafting decorations, you need an **easel**. Befriend **Mushra**, the forest artist who lives in the mushroom house. Once you become acquaintances, she'll gift you an easel to get started.

Place the easel in your home, then click on it. You'll see two options:

- **Craft Workshop** — Opens the **Decoration Workshop** where you craft paints, canvases, flower arrangements, and potted plants
- **Draw** — Opens the **Painting Easel** where you draw or import images to create framed paintings

## The Decoration Workshop

The workshop is where you craft decoration materials and decorations. It has three tabs:

### Craft Paints

Craft **paint pots** from foraged ingredients mixed with water or honey. Crafting a paint does two things:
1. Adds a paint pot to your inventory (used for painting frames)
2. **Permanently unlocks** that colour for drawing on the easel

You also craft **blank canvases** here from linen and a wooden frame (both from the shop). You need one canvas for each painting you create.

### Flower Arrangements

Combine foraged flowers with a ceramic vase to create beautiful arrangements.

| Arrangement | Flowers Needed | Where to Find |
|---|---|---|
| Moonpetal Arrangement | 3 moonpetals | Forest at night (spring/summer) |
| Violet Posy | 3 shrinking violets | Forest (spring) |
| Winter Frost Display | 3 frost flowers | Outdoors during winter snowfall |
| Mixed Wildflower Bouquet | 1 moonpetal + 1 violet + 1 wolfsbane | Various forest locations |
| Sunflower Vase | 3 sunflowers | Grow on your farm (summer) |

Each arrangement requires a **ceramic vase** from the shop.

### Potted Plants

Pot your harvested crops for a living decoration.

| Plant | Crop Needed | Season |
|---|---|---|
| Potted Strawberry | 2 strawberries | Spring/summer harvest |
| Potted Herbs | 2 mint | Spring/summer harvest |
| Potted Sunflower | 1 sunflower | Summer harvest |

Each potted plant requires a **plant pot** from the shop.

## The Painting Easel

The painting easel is a freehand drawing application where you create original artwork to hang in your home.

### Drawing Tools

- **Draw** — Paint on the canvas with your selected colour and brush
- **Erase** — Remove strokes from the active layer
- **Eyedropper** — Click the canvas to pick up a colour
- **Undo** — Undo your last stroke
- **Clear** — Clear the active layer entirely

You can adjust **brush size** (2–30px) and **opacity** (10–100%) using the sliders.

### Drawing Colours

You start with three basic colours: **Charcoal** (black), **Chalk** (white), and **Earth Brown**. Crafting paint pots in the workshop permanently unlocks their colours for drawing — the more paints you craft, the bigger your palette grows.

### Layers

Paintings support up to **4 layers**, letting you build up your artwork:

- **Drawing layers** — Freehand drawing with your brushes and colours
- **Image layers** — Import a picture (PNG, JPEG, or WebP) as a layer

Each layer has its own opacity and visibility controls, and you can reorder or remove layers freely.

### Creating a Painting

1. Draw your artwork (or import an image as a layer)
2. Optionally select **frame colours** — choose up to 2 paint pots from your inventory
3. Choose a **display size** (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, or XL)
4. Optionally tick **transparent background** (the canvas colour won't be included)
5. Give your painting a name and click **Save**

Each painting consumes **1 blank canvas**. Frame paints are optional for drawings — if you select them, those paint pots are consumed too.

## Paint Colours

Paints are crafted from foraged ingredients mixed with honey or water. Each forageable produces a different colour:

| Paint | Colour | Ingredient | Binding Agent | Where to Find |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Teal | Vibrant teal | Luminescent Toadstool ×2 | Water | Mushroom forest |
| Mustard Yellow | Warm yellow | Eye of Newt ×2 | Water | Wild mustard flowers |
| Violet | Delicate purple | Shrinking Violet ×2 | Water | Forest (spring) |
| Moonlit Silver | Shimmering silver | Moonpetal ×2 | Honey | Forest at night (spring/summer) |
| Deep Blue | Rich starlight blue | Addersmeat ×2 | Honey | Forest at night (spring/summer) |
| Dark Purple | Mysterious purple | Wolfsbane ×2 | Water | Forest |
| Gilded Gold | Warm gold | Phoenix Ash ×2 | Honey | Smouldering embers |
| Frost Blue | Crystalline ice blue | Frost Flower ×2 | Water | Winter snowfall only |
| Strawberry Red | Bright red | Strawberry ×3 | Water | Farm (spring/summer) |
| Spinach Green | Earthy green | Spinach ×3 | Water | Farm (spring/summer) |

## Frames

Frames are the decorative borders around your paintings. The frame style is determined by which paint pots you select when saving a painting:

| Paints Selected | Frame Style | Look |
|---|---|---|
| None | Plain Wood | Simple brown wooden frame |
| 1 regular paint | Painted Frame | Solid border in that paint's colour |
| 2 regular paints | Gradient Frame | Colour gradient between the two paints |
| Gilded Gold (1st) | Gold Filigree | Ornate golden frame with a warm glow |
| Frost Blue (1st) | Frosted Crystal | Icy crystalline border with a frosty shimmer |
| Moonlit Silver (1st) | Silver Double | Elegant double-line silver border |

Rare paints (Gold, Frost Blue, Silver) always produce their special frame style regardless of the second paint chosen. The second paint adds a secondary accent colour.

## Shopping List

These materials are available from the village shop:

## Placing Decorations

All crafted decorations are placed as **permanent items** — they never decay. To place a decoration:

1. Open your inventory
2. Select the decoration
3. Place it on any walkable tile in your home

Paintings display at whichever size you chose when creating them (Tiny through XL, relative to your character's size).

## Tips

- **Craft paints to unlock drawing colours** — Each paint you craft permanently adds its colour to your easel palette. Craft them all for a full rainbow.
- **Seasonal foraging matters** — Some paint colours are only available in certain seasons. Frost Blue requires winter snowfall, Moonlit Silver needs spring/summer nights.
- **Night foraging unlocks rare colours** — Moonpetal and addersmeat only bloom at night, producing silver and deep blue paints.
- **Use layers for complex art** — Draw a background on one layer, details on another. Adjust opacity for watercolour effects.
- **Import images** — Add a photo or drawing as an image layer, then paint over it or use it as-is.
- **Mix colours for unique frames** — Experiment with two-paint combinations for gradient frame patterns.
- **Stock up on honey** — Rare paints (Silver, Blue, Gold) use honey as a binding agent. Visit the bee hives regularly.
- **Befriend Mushra** — Chat with her in the forest and bring her gifts (she loves mushrooms and home-cooked food) to earn your easel.
