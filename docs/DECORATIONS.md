# Decorations & Crafting

## Overview

The decoration system lets you personalise your home with handmade crafts. Upload your own paintings, arrange foraged flowers in vases, or pot your favourite crops. Every decoration is crafted from materials you gather yourself.

## Getting Started

To begin crafting decorations, you need an **easel**. Befriend **Mushra**, the forest artist who lives in the mushroom house. Once you become acquaintances, she'll gift you an easel to get started.

Place the easel in your home, then click on it to open the **Decoration Workshop**.

## Decoration Types

### Framed Paintings

Upload your own pictures and display them as framed art in your home!

**How it works:**
1. Craft **paint pots** from foraged ingredients
2. Craft a **blank canvas** from linen and a wooden frame (both from the shop)
3. Click your easel to open the painting workshop
4. Upload an image, choose your frame colours, and create!

The paint colours you select determine the **frame style** around your painting:
- **One colour** creates a solid frame
- **Two colours** create a gradient or patterned frame
- **Rare paints** unlock special frame styles (gold filigree, frosted glass, and more)

Each painting consumes one canvas and one or two paint pots.

### Flower Arrangements

Combine foraged flowers with a ceramic vase to create beautiful arrangements.

| Arrangement | Flowers Needed | Where to Find |
|---|---|---|
| Moonpetal Arrangement | 3 moonpetals | Forest at night (spring/summer) |
| Violet Posy | 3 shrinking violets | Forest (spring) |
| Winter Frost Display | 3 frost flowers | Outdoors during winter snowfall |
| Mixed Wildflower Bouquet | 1 moonpetal + 1 violet + 1 wolfsbane | Various forest locations |
| Sunflower Vase | 3 sunflowers | Grow on your farm (summer) |

Each arrangement requires a **ceramic vase** from the shop.

### Potted Plants

Pot your harvested crops for a living decoration.

| Plant | Crop Needed | Season |
|---|---|---|
| Potted Strawberry | 2 strawberries | Spring/summer harvest |
| Potted Herbs | 2 mint | Spring/summer harvest |
| Potted Sunflower | 1 sunflower | Summer harvest |

Each potted plant requires a **plant pot** from the shop.

## Paint Colours

Paints are crafted from foraged ingredients mixed with honey or water. Each forageable produces a different colour:

| Paint | Colour | Ingredient | Binding Agent | Where to Find |

## Tips

- **Seasonal foraging matters** - Some paint colours are only available in certain seasons. Frost blue requires winter snowfall, moonlit silver needs spring/summer nights.
- **Night foraging unlocks rare colours** - Moonpetal and addersmeat only bloom at night, producing silver and deep blue paints.
- **Mix colours for unique frames** - Experiment with two-paint combinations for different frame patterns.
- **Stock up on honey** - Rare paints (silver, blue, gold) use honey as a binding agent. Visit the bee hives regularly.
- **Befriend Mushra** - Chat with her in the forest and bring her gifts (she loves mushrooms and home-cooked food) to earn your easel.
