# World Events & Stories

## Overview

Twilight Village is a living, breathing world where things happen — not just to you, but to everyone playing. **World events** are shared happenings that all players can see and react to. **Event chains** are branching stories that unfold over time based on your choices.

## World Events

World events are community milestones shared between all players via the cloud. When something noteworthy happens in any player's game, it gets shared with everyone.

### Types of Events

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Discovery** | Rare finds and hidden things | Finding a luminescent toadstool, spotting a lost kitten |
| **Achievement** | Milestones reached | Completing a quest, mastering all recipes |
| **Seasonal** | Season-related happenings | Cherry blossoms arriving, first snowfall |
| **Community** | Collective village goals | 100 crops grown together, recipe book milestone |
| **Mystery** | Strange and unexplained things | Lights in the forest, whispers on the wind |

### How Events Happen

Events are triggered automatically by gameplay:

- **Forage a rare item** (moonpetal, wolfsbane, fly agaric) — triggers a discovery event
- **Complete a quest** — triggers an achievement event
- **Reach a community milestone** — triggers a community event

When events happen, NPCs in the village react! The Village Elder might mention mysterious lights, or Mum might comment on someone's cooking achievement.

### Seeing Events

Events appear in the world through NPC conversations. When a world event is active:

- **NPCs get new dialogue** — they'll mention recent events naturally
- **AI conversations include village news** — if you're chatting with an NPC using AI dialogue, they'll reference recent happenings
- **Events persist** — they remain visible to all players until they expire

## Event Chains (Stories)

Event chains are **branching stories** that unfold across your village. Each chain is a narrative with multiple paths based on your decisions.

### How Stories Work

1. A story begins — perhaps something is discovered, or a season changes
2. NPCs start talking about it — you'll hear about it through dialogue
3. **You make choices** — when talking to relevant NPCs, new dialogue options appear
4. The story branches — your choice leads to different outcomes
5. The story resolves — with different endings depending on your path

### Example: The Lost Kitten

A tiny ginger kitten is spotted near the village well. What happens next depends on you:

```
Found a kitten by the well
       |
    What do you do?
    /       |       \
Take it  Search for  Ask the
 home    its owner    witch
   |        |          |
   |    Nobody     "Ginger cats
   |    claims it   bring luck!"
   |    /      \       |
   | Adopt  Let it be  |
   |  it    the village |
   |         cat        |
    \       |         /
     Happy ending!
```

Each path triggers different world events, gives different NPC reactions, and may offer different rewards.

### Current Stories

These event chains are available in the game:

#### Strange Lights in the Forest
*Type: Mystery*

Mysterious lights have been spotted in the forest. You can investigate bravely, wait patiently, or consult the witch (if you've completed her garden quest). Each path reveals something different about the ancient woods.

#### Autumn Harvest Festival
*Type: Community — Triggered in Autumn*

The village comes together for the harvest festival. Will you organise a cooking competition, a decoration drive, or a produce fair? Your choice shapes the celebration.

#### The Lost Kitten
*Type: Discovery*

A lost kitten appears near the village well. Help decide its fate — adopt it yourself, find its owner, or let it become the village's beloved communal cat.

### Story Progress

Your progress through event chains is saved automatically. If you close the game and come back, you'll pick up right where you left off. Stories that have waiting periods (like "wait 2 days") advance with the in-game calendar.

## NPC Reactions

Both world events and event chains affect how NPCs talk to you:

### Static Dialogue Changes
When a world event or chain stage is active, NPCs may have entirely new dialogue options. For example:
- The **Village Elder** comments on village happenings
- **Mum** reacts to community milestones
- **Mushra** notices changes in the forest
- The **Witch** offers wisdom about mysterious events

### AI Dialogue Awareness
If you're using AI chat mode with an NPC, they're aware of:
- Active quests and your progress
- Recent world events from other players
- Ongoing event chain stories
- Your friendship level

This means conversations feel natural and connected to what's happening in the village.

## Friendship & Dialogue

Some dialogue options and story branches are only available at certain friendship levels:

| Tier | Points | Access |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Stranger** | 0-299 | Basic dialogue |
| **Acquaintance** | 300-599 | More personal conversations, some story branches |
| **Good Friend** | 600-900 | Deep dialogue, special story paths, NPC favours |

Build friendships by talking to NPCs daily and giving them gifts they like!

## Tips

- **Talk to everyone regularly** — NPCs reference world events in conversation
- **Check back after events** — NPCs may have new things to say
- **Build friendships** — higher friendship unlocks more story branches
- **Complete quests** — some story paths require quest completion
- **Play across seasons** — seasonal events trigger automatically
