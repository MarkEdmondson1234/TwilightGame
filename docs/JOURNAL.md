# Quest Journal

## Overview

Your Journal keeps track of everything happening in your adventure — active quests, completed stories, and conversations with NPCs.

## Opening the Journal

There are three ways to open your journal:

- Press **J** on your keyboard
- Click the **Journal** book on the bookshelf in the cottage
- *(Touch/iPad)* Use the journal button in the touch controls

Press **J** again or **Escape** to close it.

## Journal Tabs

### Active Quests

Shows all your current quest chains with:

- **Quest name** and description
- **Current stage** — what you need to do next
- **Progress bar** — how far through the quest chain you are

Quests update as you explore, talk to NPCs, and discover new areas. Check back often to see what's changed!

### History

A record of completed quest chains:

- **Quest name** with a "Completed" badge
- **Summary** of key events and choices you made
- Scroll through to revisit your adventure so far

### Conversations

Summaries of your AI conversations with NPCs:

- **Per-NPC pages** with their portrait
- **Core memories** — the most important moments in your relationship
- **Recent chat excerpts** — what you've discussed lately

This tab only appears if you've had AI conversations (requires an API key — see the AI Chat help page).

## Quest System

### How Quests Work

Quests are story chains that unfold as you play:

1. **Discovery** — Quests can start by talking to NPCs, visiting locations, or special events
2. **Stages** — Each quest has multiple stages with objectives
3. **Choices** — Some quests let you make decisions that affect the outcome
4. **Rewards** — Completing quests can give you items, gold, or unlock new areas

### Tips

- **Talk to everyone** — NPCs often have new quests after you complete earlier ones
- **Explore new areas** — Some quests trigger when you visit specific locations
- **Check the season** — Certain quests are only available in specific seasons
- **Revisit NPCs** — They may have new things to say as your friendship grows

## Cloud Sync

If you're signed in, your journal data syncs to the cloud:

- Quest progress saves automatically
- NPC conversation memories carry across devices
- You won't lose your progress if you switch browsers
