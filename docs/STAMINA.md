# Stamina System

Your character has a stamina bar that represents their energy level. Managing your stamina is key to a productive day on the farm!

## How Stamina Works

- **Maximum Stamina**: 100 points
- **Stamina Bar**: Appears above your character when low (under 25%) or when you hover over them
- **Green Bar**: Normal stamina levels
- **Red Pulsing Bar**: Low stamina warning!

## What Drains Stamina

### Walking
Moving around the world slowly drains your stamina. Standing still doesn't use any energy.

### Farm Activities
Different activities cost different amounts of stamina:

| Activity | Stamina Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| Tilling soil | 2 |
| Planting seeds | 1 |
| Watering crops | 1 |
| Harvesting | 3 |
| Foraging | 2 |
| Cooking | 5 |

## Restoring Stamina

### Eating Food
Food restores stamina! Different foods restore different amounts:

| Food | Stamina Restored |
|------|-----------------|
| Tea | 5 |
| Cookies | 10 |
| Ice Cream | 15 |
| Bread | 15 |
| French Toast | 20 |
| Marzipan Chocolates | 20 |
| Crepes | 25 |
| Chocolate Cake | 25 |
| Pizza | 30 |
| Spaghetti | 35 |
| Roast Dinner | 50 |

### Resting at Home
Being inside your home slowly restores stamina over time. It's a good place to recover!

### Sleeping (New Session)
If you close the game and come back after 2 hours or more, your stamina will be fully restored - as if your character had a good night's sleep!

### Potions
- **Healing Salve**: Restores 50 stamina
- **Wakefulness Brew**: Fully restores stamina to 100

## What Happens When You Run Out?

If your stamina reaches zero, you'll collapse from exhaustion! Don't worry though - you'll wake up at home with full stamina. No harm done, but you might lose some time.

## Tips

1. **Keep snacks handy** - Always carry some food for emergencies
2. **Plan your work** - Do stamina-heavy tasks (harvesting, cooking) when you're well-rested
3. **Use your home** - Pop inside to rest and recover between activities
4. **Watch the bar** - When it turns red and starts pulsing, find food soon!
5. **Brew potions** - The Wakefulness Brew is perfect for long work sessions
