# Time and Seasons Guide

The world changes with time! Experience the passage of days, seasons, and years as you play.

## The Clock

Look at the **HUD in the top-left corner** to see:
- Current day number
- Current season
- Current time of day (Day or Night)
- Current year

**Example:** "Day 5, Summer, Day, Year 1"

## How Time Passes

Time moves automatically as you play:

- **1 real-world hour ‚âà 1 game hour**
- **24 game hours = 1 full day**
- **28 days = 1 full year**

This means it takes about **1 day in real life** to experience a full game day, and about **28 real days** to complete a full game year!

**Don't worry!** Time is relaxed and unhurried. There are no deadlines or time limits. Play at your own pace!

## Day and Night

The world alternates between day and night every hour:

### Daytime ‚òÄÔ∏è
- **Even hours** (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22)
- Bright, vibrant colours
- Standard lighting
- Most activities happen during the day

### Night-time üåô
- **Odd hours** (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23)
- Darker, moodier colours
- Atmospheric lighting
- Everything still works - farm, explore, and gather!

**Note:** Night-time isn't actually dark or hard to see - it just uses different colours to create atmosphere. You can play normally!

## The Four Seasons

The year has four seasons, each lasting **7 days**:

### Spring üå∏ (Days 1-7)
- Fresh, bright greens
- New beginnings
- Perfect time to start your farm!

### Summer ‚òÄÔ∏è (Days 8-14)
- Warm, lush colours
- Prime growing season
- Great for farming

### Autumn üçÇ (Days 15-21)
- Golden, rustic tones
- Harvest time
- Beautiful scenery

### Winter ‚ùÑÔ∏è (Days 22-28)
- Cool, frosted colours
- End of the year approaching
- Still fully playable!

After Day 28, the year ends and you start Year 2 with Day 1, Spring again!

Each season brings different colours and moods. Take screenshots! Explore familiar areas in new seasons!

Plant crops that will be ready next season. Watch your farm evolve through the full year cycle.

## Debug Features

### Time Override (F3 Debug Menu)
The debug overlay (press F3) shows:
- Exact time information

**Note:** Time currently cannot be manually changed - it flows naturally. This keeps things fair and relaxed!

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I speed up time?**

A: Not currently! Time flows at a steady, relaxed pace. This gives you plenty of time to farm, explore, and enjoy the world.

**Q: What happens at midnight?**

A: The hour changes from 23 to 0, and you start a new day! The day counter increments.

**Q: What happens on Day 28?**

A: You complete the year! Day 29 becomes Day 1, and the year counter increments. Spring returns!

**Q: Do crops care about seasons?**

A: Currently, no! All crops grow at the same rate year-round. This might change in future updates.

**Q: Is night-time dangerous?**

A: Not at all! Night is purely atmospheric. No monsters, no penalties, no danger. Farm and explore freely!

**Q: Can I sleep to skip time?**

A: There's no sleep mechanic currently. Time flows continuously as you play.

**Q: What if I don't play for a week?**

A: Time only passes while you're playing! If you take a break, you'll resume exactly where you left off. Your crops won't die and nothing bad will happen.

**Q: How long is a year in real time?**

A: About **28 real-world days** (since 1 game day ‚âà 1 real day). But remember, time only flows when you're playing!

## The Passage of Time

### Crops and Time
Crops use real timestamps, so:
- A 5-minute crop takes 5 real minutes to grow
- You can plant it and come back later
- Time keeps tracking even when you're away (within your play session)

### Save System
When you save and exit:
- Current time is saved
- Your progress is saved
- Crops remember when they were planted

When you return:
- Time continues from where you left off
- Crops continue growing based on timestamps
- Everything picks up naturally!
