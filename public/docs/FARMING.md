# Farming Guide

Welcome to farming! Grow crops, earn gold, and create your thriving farm.

## Getting Started

### Finding Farm Plots

Look for **brown soil tiles** - these are your farm plots! You'll find them in:
- The farm area (southeast of the village)
- Near your cottage
- Special farming zones on some maps

### Your Farming Tools

Press these keys to select your tool:

- **1** - Hand (harvest crops, clear dead plants, pick wild berries)
- **2** - Hoe (prepare soil for planting)
- **3** - Seeds (plant crops)
- **4** - Watering Can (water your plants)

The HUD in the top-left shows your currently selected tool.

### Click to Interact

You can also **click directly on farm tiles** to interact with them! A circular menu will appear showing available actions based on your current tool.

## How to Farm

### Step 1: Till the Soil

1. Walk to a **brown fallow soil** tile
2. Press **2** to equip your hoe
3. Press **E** to till the soil
4. The soil becomes tilled and ready for planting!

### Step 2: Plant Seeds

1. Stand on a **tilled soil** tile
2. Press **3** to equip seeds
3. Press **E** to plant - a menu appears showing your available seeds
4. Select which crop to plant
5. A young plant appears and grows over time!

**Available Crops:**
- Radish, Tomato, Strawberry, Pea, Sunflower, Salad, Corn, Pumpkin, and more!

**Note:** You need seeds in your inventory to plant. Get free starter seeds from the Seed Shed in the farm area!

**Seasonal Planting:** Some crops can only be planted in certain seasons. Check if your seeds can be planted in the current season!

### Step 3: Water Your Crops

1. Stand on a **planted crop** tile
2. Press **4** to equip your watering can
3. Press **E** to water
4. The soil becomes darker and wet 💧

**Important:** Crops need water to grow! Without water, they'll wilt and eventually die.

### Step 4: Harvest

1. Wait for your crop to mature (check the growth time)
2. When ready, the plant looks full and mature - you'll see a large, beautiful plant!
3. Stand on the tile
4. Press **1** to equip your hand (or just click the crop)
5. Press **E** to harvest
6. You get crops AND bonus seeds in your inventory!

**Bonus Seeds:** When you harvest, you'll receive 1-3 seeds of that crop type back. This helps you replant and expand your farm!

The tile becomes fallow again, ready to till and plant another crop.

## Crop Growth Times

Different crops take different amounts of time to grow. Watered crops grow faster!

| Crop | Growth Time | Watered | Seasons |
|------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Radish | 2 min | 1.5 min | Spring, Summer, Autumn |
| Pea | 3 min | 2 min | Spring, Summer |
| Strawberry | 4 min | 3 min | Spring, Summer |
| Tomato | 5 min | 3.5 min | Spring, Summer |
| Sunflower | 6 min | 4 min | Summer |
| Salad | 10 min | 7 min | Spring, Summer |
| Corn | 15 min | 10 min | Summer |
| Pumpkin | 20 min | 14 min | Autumn |

**Tip:** Start with radishes or peas to learn the system quickly, then try longer crops for better profits!

## Fertiliser & Quality

### Using Fertiliser

You can apply **fertiliser** to growing crops to improve their quality:

1. Have fertiliser in your inventory
2. Stand on a **planted** crop (not ready yet)
3. Use the fertiliser tool or click the crop
4. The crop's quality improves!

### Quality Levels

Crops come in three quality levels:

| Quality | Appearance | Sell Value |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Normal | Standard | 1x |
| Good | Slightly better | 1.5x |
| Excellent | Premium | 2x |

Higher quality = more gold when you sell!

## What Happens If I Forget to Water?

If you don't water your crops, they'll go through these stages:

1. **Planted** - Freshly planted, needs water soon
2. **Wilting** - Getting thirsty! Water now or it will die
3. **Dead** - Too late, the plant died 💀

**Clearing Dead Crops:**
1. Press **1** to equip your hand
2. Stand on the dead crop
3. Press **E** to clear it
4. The tile becomes fallow soil again

## Farm Tile Colours

The soil changes colour to show its state:

- **Brown** - Fallow soil (needs tilling)
- **Tilled** - Ready for planting
- **Darker/Wet** - Watered (good!)
- **Dry** - Needs water!

## Tips for Success

### Water Regularly
Check your crops daily! Water them before they wilt to keep them healthy.

### Plan Your Farm
- Plant fast crops (radishes) when you're playing actively
- Plant slow crops (pumpkins) before you take a break
- Mix crop types for steady income

### Use the Seed Shed
Visit the Seed Shed in the farm area to get more seeds from friendly NPCs. They'll give you starter seeds for free!

### Watch the Seasons
Different crops grow in different seasons:
- **Spring:** Radish, Pea, Strawberry, Tomato, Salad
- **Summer:** Most crops grow well
- **Autumn:** Pumpkin, Radish
- **Winter:** Limited growing season

Check the current season in the HUD before planting!

### Check Your Inventory
The HUD shows:
- How many seeds you have
- Which seed type is selected
- Your current tool
- Your gold total

### Start Small
Don't plant 50 crops at once on your first day! Start with a few plots, learn the system, then expand your farm.

## Wild Foraging

You can also gather food from the wild!

### Wild Strawberries
Find **wild strawberry bushes** in meadows and forest edges. Use your hand to pick them - you'll get 2-5 strawberries, and sometimes bonus seeds!

### Blackberries
In **summer**, you can pick blackberries from bramble bushes. Stand next to a bramble and use your hand to gather 3-7 blackberries.

### Water Collection
Use your **watering can** at wells to collect water. Look for wells in the village and farm areas.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

## Common Questions

**Q: Where do I get seeds?**

A: Three ways! Visit the Seed Shed for free starter seeds, harvest crops to get bonus seeds back, or forage for wild strawberry seeds.

**Q: How do I know when a crop is ready?**

A: The plant grows visually larger as it matures. When ready, it appears as a large, full-grown plant. You can click it to harvest!

**Q: Do I have to replant after harvesting?**

A: Yes! Harvesting returns the tile to fallow soil. You'll need to till it again and plant new seeds.

**Q: Why can't I plant this crop?**

A: Check the season! Some crops can only be planted in certain seasons. The game will tell you if a crop can't be planted now.

**Q: What if I run out of watering can water?**

A: The watering can has unlimited uses! You can also refill it at wells around the village and farm.

**Q: What does fertiliser do?**

A: Fertiliser improves crop quality from normal to good, or from good to excellent. Higher quality crops sell for more gold!

**Q: What do I do with harvested crops?**

A: They go in your inventory and can be sold for gold, or used in cooking recipes!

## Example Farming Session

Here's a typical farming routine:

1. **Morning:** Walk to your farm plots
2. **Water:** Water any planted crops (press 4, then E on each crop)
3. **Harvest:** Collect any mature crops (press 1, then E on ready plants)
4. **Replant:** Plant new seeds in the harvested plots (press 3, select seed, press E)
5. **Water again:** Water the newly planted crops (press 4, then E)
6. **New plots:** Till and plant any unused fallow soil
7. **Evening:** Come back and water everything one more time

**Result:** Happy, growing crops! 🌾

## Advanced Tips

### Crop Rotation
Try planting different crops in rotation to keep things interesting and maximize your income.

### Seasonal Strategy
- **Spring:** Plant strawberries and peas early
- **Summer:** This is prime growing time - plant sunflowers and tomatoes!
- **Autumn:** Switch to wheat and pumpkins before winter
- **Winter:** Focus on other activities, or plan for spring

### Time Management
Plant short crops (radishes) when you'll be around to harvest them soon. Plant long crops (pumpkins) before bed or when you're taking a break.

### Quality Boost
Always use fertiliser on valuable slow-growing crops like pumpkins. The quality bonus is worth it!

### Farm Layout
Create neat rows or patterns! While it's not required, an organised farm is easier to manage.

### Gold Strategy
- Fast crops = quick small profits
- Slow crops = patient big profits
- Fertilised crops = premium profits
- Mix all three for balanced income

### Wild Harvesting
Don't forget to forage! Wild strawberries and blackberries are free food and seeds.
