# Farming Guide

Welcome to farming! Grow crops, earn gold, and create your thriving farm.

## Getting Started

### Finding Farm Plots

Look for **brown soil tiles** - these are your farm plots! You'll find them in:
- The farm area (southeast of the village)
- Near your cottage
- Special farming zones on some maps

### Your Farming Tools

Press these keys to select your tool:

- **1** - Hand (harvest crops, clear dead plants)
- **2** - Hoe (prepare soil for planting)
- **3** - Seeds (plant crops)
- **4** - Watering Can (water your plants)

The HUD in the top-left shows your currently selected tool.

## How to Farm

### Step 1: Till the Soil

1. Walk to a **brown fallow soil** tile
2. Press **2** to equip your hoe
3. Press **E** to till the soil
4. The soil becomes tilled and ready for planting!

### Step 2: Plant Seeds

1. Stand on a **tilled soil** tile
2. Press **3** to equip seeds
3. Select which crop to plant (press 5-9):
   - **5** - Radish (grows in 2 minutes)
   - **6** - Tomato (grows in 5 minutes)
   - **7** - Wheat (grows in 10 minutes)
   - **8** - Corn (grows in 15 minutes)
   - **9** - Pumpkin (grows in 20 minutes)
4. Press **E** to plant
5. A young plant appears! ðŸŒ±

**Note:** You need seeds in your inventory to plant. Get free starter seeds from the Seed Shed in the farm area!

### Step 3: Water Your Crops

1. Stand on a **planted crop** tile
2. Press **4** to equip your watering can
3. Press **E** to water
4. The soil becomes darker and wet ðŸ’§

**Important:** Crops need water to grow! Without water, they'll wilt and eventually die.

### Step 4: Harvest

1. Wait for your crop to mature (check the growth time)
2. When ready, the plant looks full and mature ðŸŒ¾
3. Stand on the tile
4. Press **1** to equip your hand
5. Press **E** to harvest
6. You get crops in your inventory and gold! ðŸ’°

The tile becomes tilled again, ready to plant another crop.

## Crop Growth Times

Different crops take different amounts of time to grow:

| Crop | Growth Time | Value |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Radish | 2 minutes | Low |
| Tomato | 5 minutes | Medium |
| Wheat | 10 minutes | Good |
| Corn | 15 minutes | High |
| Pumpkin | 20 minutes | Premium |

**Tip:** Start with radishes to learn the system quickly, then try longer crops for better profits!

## What Happens If I Forget to Water?

If you don't water your crops, they'll go through these stages:

1. **Planted** - Freshly planted, needs water soon
2. **Wilting** - Getting thirsty! Water now or it will die
3. **Dead** - Too late, the plant died ðŸ’€

**Clearing Dead Crops:**
1. Press **1** to equip your hand
2. Stand on the dead crop
3. Press **E** to clear it
4. The tile becomes fallow soil again

## Farm Tile Colours

The soil changes colour to show its state:

- **Brown** - Fallow soil (needs tilling)
- **Tilled** - Ready for planting
- **Darker/Wet** - Watered (good!)
- **Dry** - Needs water!

## Tips for Success

### Water Regularly
Check your crops daily! Water them before they wilt to keep them healthy.

### Plan Your Farm
- Plant fast crops (radishes) when you're playing actively
- Plant slow crops (pumpkins) before you take a break
- Mix crop types for steady income

### Use the Seed Shed
Visit the Seed Shed in the farm area to get more seeds from friendly NPCs. They'll give you starter seeds for free!

### Watch the Seasons
Some crops might grow better in certain seasons. Experiment to find what works best!

### Check Your Inventory
The HUD shows:
- How many seeds you have
- Which seed type is selected
- Your current tool
- Your gold total

### Start Small
Don't plant 50 crops at once on your first day! Start with a few plots, learn the system, then expand your farm.

## Common Questions

**Q: Where do I get seeds?**

A: Visit the Seed Shed in the farm area. Talk to the NPCs inside to get free starter seeds!

**Q: How do I know when a crop is ready?**

A: The plant sprite changes to look mature and full. It's visually obvious when it's ready to harvest!

**Q: Do I have to replant after harvesting?**

A: Yes! Harvesting returns the tile to tilled soil. You'll need to plant new seeds, but you can skip the tilling step.

**Q: Can I change my mind about which crop to plant?**

A: Once planted, you're committed to that crop. If you want to change, you'll need to wait for it to die or harvest it first.

**Q: What if I run out of watering can water?**

A: The watering can has unlimited uses! Water away!

**Q: Can other players steal my crops?**

A: This is a single-player game - your farm is all yours!

**Q: What do I do with harvested crops?**

A: They go in your inventory and can be sold for gold. More uses for crops may come in future updates!

## Example Farming Session

Here's a typical farming routine:

1. **Morning:** Walk to your farm plots
2. **Water:** Water any planted crops (press 4, then E on each crop)
3. **Harvest:** Collect any mature crops (press 1, then E on ready plants)
4. **Replant:** Plant new seeds in the harvested plots (press 3, select seed, press E)
5. **Water again:** Water the newly planted crops (press 4, then E)
6. **New plots:** Till and plant any unused fallow soil
7. **Evening:** Come back and water everything one more time

**Result:** Happy, growing crops! ðŸŒ¾

## Advanced Tips

### Crop Rotation
Try planting different crops in rotation to keep things interesting and maximize your income.

### Time Management
Plant short crops (radishes) when you'll be around to harvest them soon. Plant long crops (pumpkins) before bed or when you're taking a break.

### Farm Layout
Create neat rows or patterns! While it's not required, an organized farm is easier to manage.

### Gold Strategy
- Fast crops = quick small profits
- Slow crops = patient big profits
- Mix both for balanced income

**Happy farming! May your harvests be bountiful! ðŸŒ¾**
