## Part 1: Finding the Witch

**Source**: The Old Woman (Althea)

**The Old Woman's Chores**:
Before she will reveal the witch's location, you need to:

3. Clean her house by removing all the spider webs

**Reward**: An entrance to the witch's level appears in the forest.

## Part 2: Meeting the Witch

**Location**: A magical glade (where plants with magical properties also grow)

**The Witch's Condition**:
She says she hasn't had an apprentice in years. To convince her to take you on, you need to show your commitment.

**Proving Yourself**:
1. Grow her a kitchen garden
2. Produce a crop of at least 3 different types of plants
3. Make pickled onions (she likes these in her sandwiches)
