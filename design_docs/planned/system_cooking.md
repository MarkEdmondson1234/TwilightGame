# Cooking System

Mother can teach you how to cook, starting with French Toast.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**:
- Activate a certain line of conversation with Mother
- Mother will teach you how to make French Toast
- You need to go to the shop to buy ingredients
- For that, you also need money

## Earning Money

Several ways to earn money:

| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Shop deliveries | Work for 3 days doing deliveries |
| Foraging | Gather items in the forest, sell to travelling salesman |
| Farming | Grow vegetables, sell to shop or travelling salesman |

## Cooking Specialisations

After cooking French Toast successfully, you unlock 3 different directions:

1. **Savoury Food**
2. **Desserts**
3. **Baking**

You can learn 3 recipes in each category.

## Recipes by Category

### Savoury Food
- Spaghetti with meat sauce
- Pizza with potatoes
- Roast dinner

### Desserts
- Crêpes with strawberry jam
- Marzipan chocolates
- Vanilla ice cream

### Baking

## Starting Recipe

**Tea**: You can cook this from the beginning (Mother stocks the ingredients).

## Cooking Location

You can use the stove in Mother's kitchen, but you need to buy or grow many of the ingredients.

## Advanced Cooking

**Cookbook**:
When you have mastered all 3 categories, you can use a Cookbook, which makes you able to cook even more recipes.

## Using Food for Friendship

You can increase your relationships with the villagers by serving them food.
