# Quest: The Bear and the Truffles

A quest that begins in the first autumn.

## Timeline

**Trigger**: Year 1, Autumn

## Part 1: The Break-In

A bear comes through town and breaks in at the shop to steal food.

**Shopkeeper's Request**:
- The shopkeeper is very angry
- Someone needs to talk to the bear about stealing
- The bear lives deep in the forest
- The shopkeeper will give you 25% of what the bear owes if you go and get the money out of him

## Part 2: Meeting the Bear

When you visit the bear, he is very civilised - and very sorry.

**The Bear's Explanation**:
- He is hibernating soon
- Normally, he collects truffle mushrooms in the autumn
- He sells them to the travelling salesman
- This year, strangely, the truffles have been rotten
- Having no money, he got desperate
- He raided the shop to fill his empty belly
- He has no money

**Cutscene**:
He is very, very... tired... he falls asleep while you talk to him.

## Part 3: Investigation

You are left to find out what happened to the truffles this year.

**Mystery to Solve**:
- Why are the truffles rotten?
- What can be done to fix this?

## Implementation Notes

- Need to create the bear character and sprite
- Need bear's den location in forest
- Need truffle investigation mechanics
- Need to define what caused the truffle rot
- Need resolution options
- Need to define rewards/consequences

## Open Questions

- What caused the truffle rot? (pollution? curse? pest? someone sabotaging?)
- How does the player solve this mystery?
- What is the reward for helping the bear?
- Does the bear become a Special Friend?
- What happens to the shopkeeper's debt?
