Game play ideas:


Narrative timeline


During the game, certain events occur. Some are random, and some are inevitable.


Cyclic events: 


The changing of the seasons. Each season has an event:
Spring > Visit from the Easter Bunny, egg hunt minigame
Midsummer > bonfire when the witches dance
Autumn > The Harvest Festival
Midwinter > Solstice Festival


Visits from the travelling salesman, Mr Bernards. He stocks goods that are otherwise hard to come by in the village, and gives you an extra good price for your wares.


The book club: The Old Woman hosts a book club every season, when some very bookish people drop by. You can befriend them, and have them come live in the village


Randomly occurring events:


Rain, snow and storms occur during appropriate seasons. 
People get infected with the flu, and need to spend some time in bed. 
Plants get attacked by bugs
The dog runs away, and someone has to find him. 




Events that occur on a timeline


Year one, spring, day 5: A strange boy moves into the house next door. But he never comes out. You can see him though the window, and going to his house triggers a cutscene with the boy breathing on the window pane and writing HELP! in the mist. If you try to go to the door, you cannot go in, but it triggers another cutscene, where he pushes a piece of paper under the door. He has written crudely on it with a piece of charcoal: "The warlock has locked me in! He hid the key in the fairy tree in the forest! Can you get it? Please help!"


If you try to have conversations with other NPCs, it seems that they can't see the boy. 


If you can find the fairy tree in the forest, you can get the key that lets out the boy. 
The boy explains that he is a druid's apprentice, but that he fell out with his master, who banish him to the spirit plane, and locked him in the house. For some reason, only the Player Character can see him. 
The boy tells you that he is from the village, but it has been a long time, and his family is dead. In his time, people used to live in huts, not houses. 
The boy goes away for a time - he sets out to find out how he can break the curse. 
At some point he reappears. He needs your help. To break the curse, he needs a portal from the spirit realm to the realm of the living, and he needs you to guide him. 
The portal can only be cast on a midsummer's night, and he will need a bonfire to light his way back. 
If you agree to help him, you can either build your own bonfire, or you can ask to use someone else's (if you have access to the witches' glade, they have a bonfire you can borrow once they are done with their dancing). 
If you decline to help the boy, or you miss the deadline of the next midsummer, he is disappointed, and disappears. 
If you help the boy, you have a Special Friend, and you must help him settle in as a human - he can move in with you, or stay in the cottage where he was locked in. He also needs new clothes and needs to be taught modern skills like how to earn money, how to go to the shop and buy groceries, etc. 


Year one, autumn: 
A bear comes through town and breaks in at the shop to steal food. The shop keeper is very angry - someone needs to talk to the bear about stealing! The bear lives deep in the forest. The shopkeeper will give you 25% of what the bear owes if you go and get the money out of him. 
When you visit the bear, he is very civilised - and very sorry. The problem is that he is hibernating soon - and normally, he collects truffle mushrooms in the autumn and sells them to the travelling salesman, but this year, strangely, the truffles have been rotten. Having no money, the bear got desperate, and raided the shop to fill his empty belly. He has no money, and he is very, very... tired... he falls asleep while you talk to him, leaving you to find out what happened to the truffles this year. 




Befriending villagers


The key to unlocking quests is to befriend the villagers. There is an invisible stat for each villager that defines how much they like you. it goes from 1 - 9, where 1-3 is "Barely know them", 4-6 is "Aquaintance" and 7-9 is "Good friend". They will only help you, reveal secrets or give you quests if you are a Good friend.


You can take various actions to befriend villagers:


-Talk to them every day (counts 1 for each day) 
-Give them food (counts 1 for each meal)
-Give them food that they like (counts 3 for each meal)
-Do quests for them (counts for 3 for each quest)


The two villagers that like you 9 from the beginning are Mother and Father. Father, however, is an explorer, and isn't home for the first year of the game. 


To become Special Friends with someone, you have to go through a Life Crisis with them. 


For instance: If you are Good Friends with the Old Woman when the Old Man dies, and you comfort her, you become Special Friends with her. Special Friends means that the NPC will go out of their way to help you.


Characters in the game that you can become Special Friends with:


The Old Man - Name: Jebediah - Crisis: Can no longer take care of his garden. If you help, he will let you have the crops.


The Old Woman - Name: Althea - Crisis: Death of the Old Man. Help her with his funeral, and she will tell you stories of her youth with her sister, who became a witch


The Little Girl - Name: Celia - Crisis: She is alone with her mother, who becomes ill. If you help her fetch the doctor, she will show you her secret tree house. 






Kitchen garden


When you start the game, the kitchen garden is barren. You can cultivate it by buying seed in the shop, or by befriending  the old man, who used to be a gardener when he was young. When he becomes an Acquaintance, he will gift you 3 seeds: Sunflowers, Peas and Salad. 


You can buy these seeds from the shop:
Potatoes
Melon
Pumpkin
Chili
Spinach
Broccoli
Cauliflower


You can get these seeds from the old man:
Sunflowers
Tomatoes
Salad
Onion
Peas
Cucumber
Carrots




You can gather these seeds in the wild:
Strawberries


The various seeds will grow in different seasons:


Potatoes - plant spring, reap summer, autumn - price 5 gold
Melon - plant spring, reap summer, autumn
Pumpkin - plant spring, reap autumn
Chili - plant spring, summer, reap summer, autumn
Spinach - plant spring, summer, reap spring, summer, autumn
Broccoli - plant spring, reap summer, autumn
Cauliflower - plant spring, reap summer, autumn
Sunflowers - plant spring, reap summer, autumn
Tomatoes - plant spring, reap summer
Salad - plant spring, summer, reap spring, summer
Onion - plant autumn, reap spring, summer, autumn
Peas - plant spring, reap summer
Cucumber - plant spring, reap summer
Carrots - plant spring, summer, reap summer, autumn


They all need to be watered 1 time every day to succeed. If fertiliser is added to the water, the quality will be better, and you can sell them for more.


Mother's recipes


If you activate a certain line of conversation, Mother will teach you how to cook. The first recipe she teaches you is how to make French Toast. However, you need to go to the shop to buy ingredients, and for that you also need money. 


To get money in the game, there are several ways you can go about it: 


-You can work for 3 days doing deliveries for the shop
-You can do foraging in the forest, and sell it to the traveling salesman
-You can grow vegetables, and sell them to the traveling salesman or in the shop (the shop will keep the produce, and sell it back to you later, for an increased price - if you keep the crops yourself, they deteriorate within 3 days). 


Cooking French toast successfully unlocks 3 different directions to take as a cook. You can specialise in either:
-Savoury food
-Desserts 
-Baking


You can learn 3 recipes in each category. You can use the stove in mother's kitchen, but you need to buy or grow many of the ingredients. 


You can increase your relationships with the villagers by serving them food. Different villagers prefer different food:
-The shopkeeper likes Savoury food
-The small girl and the fairy like desserts 
-The old man and woman like baked goods. 


When you have mastered all 3 categories, you can Use a Cookbook, which makes you able to cook even more recipes. 


The one recipe that you can cook from the beginning is tea (mother stocks the ingredients).


Recipes: 


Savoury food: Spaghetti with meat sauce, Pizza with potatoes, Roast dinner
Desserts: Crepes with Strawberry jam, Marcipan chocolates, Vanilla icecream
Baking: Bread, Cookies, Chocolate cake




The fairy Queen's Court
The old man asks you to go into the woods and obtain 3 different wild plants. If you do it, he will reward you. The wild plants are:


Blueberries (summer, autumn)
Hazelnut (only autumn)
Elderflowers (Only spring)


The reward is a special seed for Fairy Bluebells. It flowers in summer and attracts fairies in the night. You can befriend a little fairy called Morgan, who tells you stories of the fairy queen's magical realm. If you talk to her every night for a week, she will give you fairy dust which makes plants grow up and have produce in a day. 
If you talk to Morgan again after running out of fairy dust, she suggests that you visit the fairy queen and ask her to teach you to be a fairy. However, you need to make yourself small and have wings to visit. 


The small girl who lives in the village knows where to get wings if you ask her about it. She says there are dragonflies down by the stream in the forest, but you need to build yourself a net, or buy one from the shop. To build a net, you need to make netting from rushes, and get branches from off a tree with a saw. 


The old woman knows of a magical mushroom that makes you small, but it only grows at levels deeper than level 4 in the mine, and there are goblins in there too. (You need to tell her about the fairies before she gives you this information)


You need to find the hollow tree in the forest to visit the fairy queen's court, and you can only enter by night. Inside, the Fairy Queen is having a ball (cutscene). You can ask for an audience with her, and she will grant you the title of honorary fairy for your efforts. She will also give you another quest, in which you can get the recipe for fairy dust. 


The recipe for magic
Get this quest from the fairy queen. 


In order to be able to use magic, you  have to learn from The Witch in the Woods. The old woman in the village knows where she lives, but this dialogue only unlocks if you have visited the fairy queen. 


There is a secret level in the forest that unlocks if you carry out the chores for the old woman. Before she will reveal this secret, you need to:
-Brew her a nice, hot cup of tea
-Make her some cookies (store bought won't do)
-Clean her house by removing all the spider webs


An entrance to the witch's level will then appear in the forest.


The witch lives in a magical glade (where some plants with magical properties also are). She says she hasn't had an apprentice in years, and to convince her to take you on, you need to show your commitment. You do this by:
-Growing her a kitchen garden
-Producing a crop of at least 3 different types of plants
-Make pickled onions (she likes these in her sandwiches)


If or when you do this, she accepts you as her apprentice, and you will be given your first spellbook.. 
There are 3 levels of apprentice:
1. Novice witch, where you are able to make potions. Potions can help increase/decrease friendships with people, can alter your appearance and can make you impervious to monsters and wild animals.
2. Journeyman witch, which makes you able to cast spells that alter the weather - and other stuff
3. Full witch, which makes you able to manipulate the state of all things in the game (depending on how successful your spell is). 




Witch's Brew


This quest unlocks if you reach the status of Full Witch. 


One day, you receive a ransom letter from the evil Warlock that he has kidnapped the Witch in the Woods...
